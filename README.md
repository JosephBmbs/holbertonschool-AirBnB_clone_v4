## Requirements

**General**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All  files will be interpreted on Chrome (version 57.0)
- All  files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- The code should be semistandard compliant with the flag --global $: `semistandard *.js --global $`
- All JavaScript code must be in the `scripts` folder
- It must use JQuery version 3.x
- It are not allowed to use `var`

### More Info

Before starting the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed locally:

- `$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-lxml`
- `$ sudo pip3 install flask_cors` (if not already installed)
- `$ sudo pip3 install flasgger`

If you encounter issues with dependencies, consider these potential solutions:

- For a `jsonschema` exception: `$ sudo pip3 uninstall -y jsonschema` followed by `$ sudo pip3 install jsonschema==3.0.1`
- If you encounter a `No module named 'pathlib2'` error, install `pathlib2` with `$ sudo pip3 install pathlib2`

Ensure that ports are exposed in your Vagrantfile as needed:

```ruby
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5001, host: 5001
```
